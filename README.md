 ## üöÄ Setup and Installation

 To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

 **Prerequisites:**

 -   JDK 17 or later.
 -   Apache Maven.
 -   A running MySQL server instance.

 **Steps:**

 1.  **Clone the repository:**
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management.git
     cd library-management
     ```

 2.  **Create the MySQL Database:**
     -   Log in to your MySQL server.
     -   Create a new database for the project.
         ```sql
         CREATE DATABASE library_db;
         ```

 3.  **Configure the Application:**
     -   Navigate to the `src/main/resources/` directory.
     -   Create or edit the `application.properties` file.
     -   Update the file with your MySQL database URL, username, and password. See the **Configuration** section below.

 4.  **Build and Run the Application:**
     -   Use the Maven wrapper to build and run the project.
     -   **On Linux/macOS:**
         ```bash
         ./mvnw spring-boot:run
         ```
     -   **On Windows:**
         ```bash
         mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
         ```
     The application will start by default at `http://localhost:8080`.

 ## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

 The main configuration file is located at `src/main/resources/application.properties`. It is highly recommended to use **environment variables** for sensitive data instead of hardcoding them.

 **Example `application.properties` (with Environment Variables):**

 ```properties
 # --- Database Configuration ---
 spring.datasource.url=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL}
 spring.datasource.username=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME}
 spring.datasource.password=${SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD}
 spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

 # --- JPA/Hibernate Configuration ---
 # 'update' automatically updates the schema. Use 'validate' or 'none' in production.
 spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
 spring.jpa.show-sql=true
 spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true
 ```

 **Set the following environment variables on your system:**

 -   `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`: `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/library_db`
 -   `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`: `your-mysql-username`
 -   `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`: `your-mysql-password`

 ## üíª Usage

 Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

 -   **Home Page (`/`):** A welcome screen with navigation links.
 -   **Members Page (`/members`):** View, add, edit, and delete library members.
 -   **Books Page (`/books`):** View, add, edit, and delete books.
 -   **Borrowings Page (`/borrowings`):** View all borrowing records, issue a new book, or mark a book as returned.
